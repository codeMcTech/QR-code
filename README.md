## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This project reinforced the importance of responsive design using flexbox and CSS media queries. I also learned about using margins and padding, and also learnt how to use columns in my main container. Here are some key takeaways:

```css
.container {
    max-width: 320px;
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```
